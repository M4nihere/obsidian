#### Legacy Architecture:

- **Hosting Platform**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk was used for application hosting.
- **SSL Management**: Secured web traffic through Cloudflare's proxy services.
- **Environment Configuration**: `.env` files were included with application code, which posed potential security risks.
- **Operating System**: The production environment used Amazon Linux (RHEL family), while the development environment was on Ubuntu (Debian family), leading to inconsistencies.
- **Database Access**: Database access had broader permissions, potentially increasing the risk of unauthorized access.

**Limitations of the Legacy Architecture:**

1. **Limited Control**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk abstracted many infrastructure details, making customizations and troubleshooting challenging.
2. **External Dependency**: SSL management relied on Cloudflare, introducing an external dependency and increasing latency.
3. **Security Risks**: Sensitive environment variables were stored in `.env` files within the codebase, increasing the risk of credential exposure.
4. **Scalability Constraints**: The architectureâ€™s predefined structure limited the ability to scale or optimize for specific needs.
5. **Deployment Delays**: The deployment process was slower and less efficient.
6. **Environment Inconsistency**: Development was on Ubuntu while production used Amazon Linux, causing potential compatibility and testing issues.
7. **Database Vulnerability**: Wider access permissions to the database increased potential security risks.

#### Modern Architecture:

- **Code Management**: Upgraded to AWS services like CodeCommit, CodePipeline, and CodeDeploy for streamlined application development and deployment.
- **Deployment Environment**: Applications are deployed to secure Ubuntu-based servers located in a private network. These servers are directly accessible only via APIs, enhancing security.
- **SSL Management**: SSL is now managed directly through AWS Load Balancer, ensuring improved control and scalability for secure connections.
- **Environment Configuration**: Credentials are securely transferred and managed using AWS Secrets Manager, eliminating the need to include sensitive data in the codebase.
- **Operating System**: The production environment has been standardized to Ubuntu (Debian family), matching the development environment. This ensures consistency across all environments, reducing testing complexities and increasing reliability.
- **Database Access**: Amazon RDS is now configured to allow access only from authorized application servers, ensuring that developers can interact with the database solely through the application, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Monitoring**: Implemented monitoring for EC2 instances and RDS, tracking CPU, memory, load, disk usage, and query logs. This data is sent to Grafana via CloudWatch, providing real-time insights and proactive alerting for potential issues.

**Benefits of the Modern Architecture:**

1. **Significant Time Savings**: Deployment time has been reduced by 90%, enabling faster updates and feature rollouts.
2. **Enhanced Security**:
    - **Network Isolation**: Servers are isolated in a private network and can only be accessed via APIs, reducing exposure to potential threats.
    - **Secure Credential Management**: Environment variables and sensitive credentials are securely managed through AWS Secrets Manager.
    - **Restricted Database Access**: RDS is configured to ensure that only application servers can connect to the database, enhancing data protection.
3. **Standardized Environments**:
    - Both the development and production environments now use Ubuntu (Debian family), ensuring consistency across all stages of deployment.
    - This eliminates compatibility issues between development and production, simplifying testing and debugging processes.
    - Developers can work in an environment identical to production, leading to more reliable deployments.
4. **Greater Control and Flexibility**: The new architecture provides complete control over the infrastructure, allowing for tailored configurations and optimizations.
5. **Improved Scalability**: The architecture supports flexible scaling and optimization based on specific application needs, facilitating growth and adaptability.
6. **Streamlined Workflow**: AWS CodeCommit, CodePipeline, and CodeDeploy enable faster and more efficient development and deployment processes, reducing manual interventions and potential errors.
7. **Better Operating System Support**: Transitioning to Ubuntu offers broader community support, compatibility, and stability for application hosting.
8. **Proactive Monitoring**:
    - Real-time monitoring of EC2 instances and RDS for CPU, memory, disk usage, and query logs helps detect issues before they impact performance.
    - The data sent to Grafana via CloudWatch enables comprehensive visualizations and proactive alerting, improving system reliability and reducing downtime.
